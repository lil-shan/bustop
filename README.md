Kerala State Road Trasport Co-orperation or KSRTC for short is the state owned public transportation facility in kerala KSRTCâ€™s income per day is Rs 4.39 crore but the expenditure amounts to Rs 8.76 crore. These costs include pensions and salaries and many people haven't received this amount in months . The daily loss of KSRTC is Rs 4.37 crore . We have taken the initiative to make this app taking this concern into consideration. Most buses have stopped running because of these heavy losses. India is one of the fastest developing country and the most amount of digital transactions are done in India but the public sector is still not digitalized. In this app, we aim to digitalize the public transportation sector by digitalising the payment and allowing users to prebook tickets and view the bus timings and other details from point A to point B. the data collected by the app can be used to understand and acquire more knowledge on the bus routes and optimise the experience further for users and at the same time be profitable
